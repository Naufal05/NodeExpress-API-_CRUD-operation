Handling users using API, we are going to make 5 different routes:
1. GET - /users finds all users
2. POST - /users create a user
3. GET - /users/:id finds user details
4. DELETE - /users/:id delete a user
5. PATCH - /users/:id  updates a user

//initialise router
const router = Express.Router();

Browsers are use only Get request, that is why Postman is used to check other different request


//post users to the dattabase

//get specific user
npm install uuid

const userWithId = { ...user, id: userId };
-spread all the properties of the user using the spread operator

req.params

//change the user detail / updates
PATCH- for updates    PUt- to overwrite
